# SoilMap

This repository facilitates access to several soil related data sources like temperature fluctuations, pH values and water content by requesting a position given in latitude and logitude.

## Software requirements

### conda/apt

gdal 

## Data Sources

### Long-term MODIS Land Surface Temperature:

For the northern hemisphere, minimum temperatures are assumed as lowest night temperatures in January, maximum temperatures as highest day temperatures in July. Day-night differences are taken for April. Further description of the scaling was found in the user guide at https://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/dataprod/mod11.php .
